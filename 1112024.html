<h1> Some Updates</h1>

<p>
	Hey yall. It is me, back again. I turned 28 which was weird. These days I'm working as a food runner in a restaurant. making a little bit of money and watching a lot of movies. Next week, I am going to Austin, Texas to visit a friend and to witness the outcome of the 2024 election. I am also making a short film about it. Maybe I will see Bryan Simpson at the Comedy Mothership. I have been a little distracted but after a stretch of intense focus, so now I'm preparing to get more disciplined with my sleep eating excercise and learning schedules.

Took a new job as a dishwasher in a country club, to earn a little extra money while I finish writing my script and album, squeezing in coding practice and trying to keep up with all the newest films. It will be a challenge but I know i can pull it off.
