<h1> The Rage I Feel Towards Authority - January 24, 2025 </h1>

<p>
When I was young, I was operating under the impression that everyone is trying their best, and that other people were just as special as me. Everybody has something to contribute! Everyone has someone. Theres someone out there for everyone. Every TV Show and Movie i watched subliminally carried this message, even some of the cutting edge and challenging ones. At the end of the day, struggle makes us better people. And no one's perfect, but we're trying our best and its the thought that counts.
</p>
<p>
Now I am pretty much convinced that this was always a lie. Not everyone has something to contribute. In fact, the vast majority of people do not care about trying to do good in the world. They only care about being safe. They care about meeting their basic needs. And they don't hink beyond that. And they don't want to.This is the epitome of blind consumerism. Shove more passive content into my brain while I eat cheap disgusting poison carelessly. I don't feel sympathy for theese people. They aren't trying their best. They aren't trying AT ALL.
</p>

Some folks McGyver together a shitty map of meaning. Once you become a parent, they say, once you become a parent, everything changes. It's not about me anymore, they say, its about them.  The tragedy I've now witnessed is that so many folks believe that having a family, or having a part to play in a need that is bigger than yourself, somehow also means that the individual no longer has to spend any time becoming who they are. This is the person that's left when the nest is empty. This is the person that is still there when the divorce papers are signed.The lie is that once one becomes a parent that their old self, from their youth, is deleted. Nuh-uh. They are still in there. and they will have an opinion about what the present version of yourself has done with their life.

Some folks will heear these days, "THERES A WAR ON FATHERS!" "NO ONE RESPECTS FATHERS ANYMORE!!!" This is a load of horseshit. The only people who say things like this are people who are unworthy of respect. Fatherhood is not a badge you wear. It's not a position you occupy. It's not an identity that superceds or replaces your individual life. A father is just a grown up baby who got someone with a womb pregnant. They didn't even do the heavy lifting in the production part of this human being. Yet somehow, many "fathers" still believe the delusion "I've earned this! I've earned respect from my spouse, children and the general public." </p>
<p>
The list of lies I've been sold by my community grows longer and longer the older I get. It sickens me that we can live in a world where we treat young people so shittily. I remember being told, "You can be whatever you want to be!" It was always a  lie. It was a lie because the people who said it didn't belive it. The most disgusting part is that we look our children in their eyes and tell them things we don't believe in, because they are children. It's not being nice, It's just a lie. Every thing I ever had going for me, every advantage, talent, promise of potential I ever had, has always been a negative according to others. You can be anything you want to!!! Except that. The audacity of these people to pretend that they know anything at all is absolutely sickening to me. A bunch of grown up children that suddenly get a little nametag from the world that says "Adult" on it. I aim to simply humiliate these people and shame them by being so excellent that it actually makes them cry when they refelct on the waste of their own life. What I would really like to do is slap them in the face. Like a bitch, slap them and bmake them fucking cry. I feel that would be justice. But unfortunately, justice isn't something I consider to be a goal. I just want my life to be the greatest adventure any human could have, and to live my fullest potential. So the extent of my wrath is to simply delete these folks from my aareness, and treat them like the sniveling NPC nothings that they are. </p>
