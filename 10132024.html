<h1> Back on my Bullshit - October 13 2024</h1>

<p>
Figured out some really cool shit with tmux and bash aliases on here. Which means this blog is about to get a whole lot cooler and I'll probably be writing more often. It's taken a lot of work to get here, Vim is tough to get started at least it was for me. I am starting to write programs in c lang which makes python seem like cake. Also getting in good shape Albuquerque is nice in the Halloween times and theres a whole slew of dope ass scary movies coming up I can't wait to see. Still lonely much of the time but I discover cool stuff any ways. Much love Che money
