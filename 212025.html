Thinking of the end goal as an exploit is quite different that adpting a trade or craft as a way of life. Is that simply old school thinking? Especially now, when i can ask an LLM question upon tailored question and get stellar information. At that point the limit of my learning potential is my ability to ask questions. So theoretically, the best person at any skill could be the one who simply asks the best questions. And then what is the limit. Then I think the limit is one's capacity and inclination for creativity. Because you can excel at any subject without being a visionary or thinking beyond one's imposed limits. But to forget about the subject, forget about dedication to a craft, forget about attaching the label to ourselves of glazier, dresmaker,artist, engineer. And simply consider the problems that frustrate us the most and the things unbuilt that inspire us the most, and skip all the rest and just do that. And that means ultimate un-pigeonholing. If I must learn to tap-dance, I will. But I don't know what I'll learn. I've only just finished carefully calculating my destination.

On one hand, I think of cinema as being the root of my knowledge tree. Everything that I know about anything probably down the line started with some movie. But Also it is one of the things I am dedicating a particular section of my life. Assuming that My future is largely up to me, I would spend maybe all of it watching and making movies. But also other things and potentially anything. menaing. First of all I will not say because I'm a filmmaker, my focus will be on the arts or in cinema or such disciplines. My level of knowledge arleady must extend to the world sof finance engineering, physics and math... Alongside the Michel Gondry films apoetry and music ... Who knows what kinds of magical powers I'll posess in my old age. And of course, I want to be on the bleeding edge of all disciplines what is the purpose o this branch of learning, whats the real goal? With a higher level of vision. Filmmakers have always had nearly the highest level of vision, behind architects who shape the world and manufaturers of high quality goods.
