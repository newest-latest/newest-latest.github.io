<h1> I deserve some recognition from this board - January 19th, 2026</h1>

<p>
Today I quit my temporary job at a Ramen Shop in South Austin. I worked there for two weeks exactly. MLK Day, extremely busy, my body produced a feeling I know all too well. My best description of this feeling is as follows: "What the FUCK am I doing here?"
</p>
<p>
I have had jobs where shitty middle managers cosplaying as someone doing something important would tell me something along the lines of: "I know you have better things to do". Of course, they didn't mean that. They said it to make me feel like I was being rude by acting like being there doing whatever stupid job I was doing at the time wasn't a complete waste of my time. I wasn't being rude. I was being honest. 
</p>
<p>
I made my dream come true. I'm in a nice spot in Austin Texas the greatest city in tyhe world period. I fucking biut the bullet and accomp[lished my 1 year goal in a week. And the feeling I have now is "It's only a matter of time until I'm earning a shit ton of money surrounded by ultra smart people. 
</p>

This mutherfucker Sully who did the podcast about xAI posts today that hye's left the company. Two days after the podcast airs. C'mon, man. I saw that fireplace. It's all about how you LOOK these days, isn't it? I just know, man. It's for others! if it's not what you want to do, why are you there? And if it's exactly where you want to be then why are you doing a fucking fireside sexy chat about it on YouTube so everyone can see? He wqas bragging, man. He's no scrub, this sully. But philosophically the dude is a moron. What a stupid use of time. How embarrassing, for him and the host of this podcast. Now it lives on as a monument to his timely exit. </p>
<p>
When one wants to leave an impression. Well he did. The podcast that ended his tenure at xAI. Maybe that's not why he left. But the fact is, that podcast will live on the internet forever, and he will spend years and years answering the same question. "What happened?" "Didn't you do that podcast like, right before you left?" Now he's moved on. SO he says. </p>
<p>
I'm here in Austin Texas. Why did I come here? I came here because all of my highest values intersect in this city. 1. Cinema, on film,. and in theatres, physical media and cinematically minded people. 2. Technology. - Tesla Motors, xAI, Oracle, Apple. 3. Stand Up Comedy. Comedy Mothership, Sunset Strip ATX, Creek and Cave. And within a month of moving here these things have been unfolding as if I am in my own versionm of the Social Network. It is surreal; and exciting, and I have no one to share it with but this empty HTML template. Boy, it feels so good to quit a fucking job. </p>
<p>
- peace and love, che money on the money. right? </p> <body>
