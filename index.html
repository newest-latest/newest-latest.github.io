<p> Hey there my name is Cheo. I am a filmmaker, record producer and developer. I started this blog to write about films books software and technology in depth. I also have a Youtube channel where you can find my films and music. I've made a few apps and making some more now. I also like bikes. 

You can follow me at LetterBoxd here: 

And the only social media I really use is X.
