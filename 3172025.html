<h1> Peer to Peer Networks - March 3rd, 2025</h1>

<p>
Am I a genius? The Bitcoin blockchain exists on a distributed network. Is this not the solution? Larry ellison was on that network computer shit. Is that reall over? So I had an Idea. Here it is.
</p>
<p>
Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.
An Iphone is much simpler to use than a desktop computer.
An Ipod, even simpler.Then I was thinking about peer to peer networks. And cyber anarchy. George Hotz believes real anarchy is impossible, does he have an edge on malice in that regard? Or is it vice versa. But cyber anarchy. Ok, look at this tinybox. AI in your house. No llm using someone elses cluster, no  limits of consumer products.Self driving too. Cheap available and it workss. Independent of ecosystems. Look at Carl Pei. Same deal. 
</p>
<p>
My idea is this: Peer to peer social media. COmputers, like phones or whatever. but way cheaper and simpler. An os that can be expanded if the user is savvy, or remain in the sandbox for everyday users.e ink screen and like rasberry pi easy chips. but they ONLY do the essential things. Text only for the most part. Email and web usage but simplified to essential information. And what about the cables? the xfinitys and timewarners ? IDK
