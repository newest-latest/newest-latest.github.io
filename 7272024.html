<h1> frances ha devastating - July 27th 2024 </h1>

<p>
Last night I watched my criterion of Frances Ha again and I was just destroyed by how good it was. It is really sad to see this woman struggle. The rich kid apartment and who are these people what is this world where money is everywhere and shes mingling in this high-class exclusive world. And shes got to take this step back and just realize shes not cool and shes just lost and broke.It blows me away how perfect this script is. Its just growing and everybody changing around you it captures those moments perfectly.

So I was devastated but also if Greta and Noah made this movie about feeling like that back then than according to them my life is just the plot of a fantastic movie like this one.

Also this is an example of how by being ultra careful and searching for what the script is putting the work into that can be all you need to kick someones ass with a movie

Working a lot recently and missing a lot of movies but this one was jsut like a reminder like come one man youre part of this
