<h1> still a developer</h1>

<p>
what can I do? What are my skills? I can code up an html page and start a shitty blog. I can do that. I can maybe solve a couple code problems. maybe write some java apps, a web app, something like that. but still largely a mystery. Alhtough its strange how sometimes you can feel like a fucking fool but also have some real deal skills that you dont even know you have until you start working on something. I'm still learning. my expectations of working in this field are fucking zero though I'm crushed. anyhow I'm writing code muther fuckers.
