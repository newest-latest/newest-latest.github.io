<h1>Learning About Scriptwriting from A Bug's Life - July 6, 2024</h1>
<p> I am in the process of writing a script for a feature film. I haven't gotten to the hard part yet. But I've had a sort of breakthrough with the easy part. On my Bug's Life Blu-Ray, there is a roundtable with the filmmakers. I learned that Flick was not originally the main character of a movie. There was another ant, a red Ant, who was the leader of the bug circus. But over time, they realized there were conflicts between this ant's story and its relationship to the other things that happen in the movie. So they changed their minds, and made Flick the main character instead. I never knew this and its even hard to believe the story was so different than the final movie.   </p>
<p> I then realized that everything I think I know about my movie, who the main character is, what happens to him, where its set, everything. Could potentially change at any moment, and that I still really don't know anything about what this movie is. The expectations I have based on what I think it is are what's preventing me from finding out what it is. Because I don't know what it is. Because it isn't done. the script doesn't exist yet, and the story that happens in in definitely does not exist. Yet. There's only a bunch of scattered puzzle pieces.</p>
<p> So now I'm actively admitting that I don't know at all where this story is going. All I know is there's a guy who looks like me in it, that he talks to some people, theres theft involved, he travels by road,there is glass blowing in it, maybe an old cowboy musician involved maybe some things happen in spokane washington. But I dont know why! and If I think I know why, I'm WRONG! I won't know why until the whole puzzle is done.
