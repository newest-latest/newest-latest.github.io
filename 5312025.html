<h1> A Fiction - May 31st 2025</h1>

<p>
remember in french dispatch when Krementz says that she is living for writing and writing only. no family. no husband. she had some sort of writing talent or something. When zuck is blogging, he doesn't smile. Only a teenager and already all joy killed and all that's left is truth. Why was I born? I have amazing Ideas, a capacity to learn and create that exceeds my contemporaries. Or is that just the narcissism?
</p>
<p>
all my life ive believed things that now haunt me, even after I've realized they were lies. Its loo late. you know what's a great feeling? being nothing. nothing. Nothing to miss. nothing to mourn the loss of. less than meaningless. a meaning of only shame and being pathetic. Reinforced by my peers and family. undeniable proof i am inferior and unworthy. Friendship meaning nothing, temporary. Dementia style. It doesnt atter who im talking to they are all friendly strangers. The only thing i trust is the void. the void of no one knowing. WThe feeling of no one knowing where I am or what I'm doing. Wrting to an audience of zero.That feels real, because all the exteranl things are a reminder of my inferior value. MY irrelevance to others. My forgettableness. MY inadequacy. the one superpower I actually got. 
</p>

The story that has transpired. Is now a part of me. Like a stranger who said now we are handcuffed together for life. You can never ever get rid of me. I was there when you were only a little kid. A reminder not only that your losing the game, but that you dont qualify to play. YOu are the runt of the litter who dies who is killed by their mother out of compassion. Jesus, this is dark. Like True West. Its not just you don't get the girl. YOu don't get the only thing you can get. You say whats the thing no one will even want. That thing can be mine. I will excel at this thing no one would even bother with. But no. There's someone else. Who does it better than you.  In fact, its embarassing the way you do it. It's embarrassing you thought you were good at this. And guess what? that guy who does your pathetic stupid interest better than you, hes got the girl too. 
</p>
<p>
I didn't choose the krementz life. I've inherited it. And I've chosen it. Like hypnosis but you cant blame anyone else. Only me. They make nerds for a reason. They make ugly weird kids for a reason.
