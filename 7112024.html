<h1>The Martian, Science fiction, billionaires - July 11, 2024</h1>
<p>
Watching Ridley Scott's The Martian which is an amazing film in so many ways. It is clear Ridley is familiar with what it takes to get a contrat with NASA, what it would take scientifically and financially to put someone on mars.
