<h1>learning about filmmaking from spider man - July 9, 2024</h1>
<p> it occurs to me while watching spider man there is a lot of differences between the final shooting script and the final movie we see on screen. I wonder, why is this? The final shooting script is usually pretty close to what we see on screen, isn't it. Not in this case, the scenes are in a different order completely. I have yet to explore the special features of the dvd but I predict that the scenes are out of order because they showed some early cuts of the film to test audiences and realized that the rhythm of the scenes wasn't delivering the story clearly or effectively enough. So in the editing room they changed it. They still had the film fully concieved on the page and shot each of the scenes specified in the shooting script, but I'm inspired by the fact that even when shooting is wrapped and the film is in editing, there are so many unknowns that can define what the film will be, and set it apart from others. I've also decided that I must play my film to some test audiences before I make the final edit.</p>
