<h1> Summer Movies Are Over and Updates- August 22nd, 2025</h1>

<p>
what did I accomplish since I last blogged? Completed my nvim config to replace my IDE. Remade my static website to make it cooler and more functional. Fixed my content creation workflow so I can reliably produce high quality content so I can gain some sort of value in the marketplace of life. Learned fundamentals of graphics programming using raylib and C language. I don't know man. A lot of screen sharing workflows between my comuter tower and my devices to improve productivity. 
</p>
<p>
Now. I have NOT been doing a lot of things that I like to do over almost the entire summer. I've been missing some of my most anticipated theatrical releases and I haven't been to the Guild Cinema in months. I've worked some and made some meager money and lost my job again so I have to find a new one which is always easy but every job I work sucks ass and steals all of my valuable time and sets it on fire. Anyways, that is hard.

<p>
I have been able to catch some not to be missed films. Eddington, Weapons, The Naked Gun, the Phoenician Scheme. I have been able to absorb some information here and there. 
</p>
<p>
But the main thing is that I feel deeply that I'm about to enter an era of insane productivity and improved quality of work. I know how im going to slice things. Now its just formula. I can't wait and also fuck its going to be hard. But I swear its my only chance at the life I want. Still here, peace, che
