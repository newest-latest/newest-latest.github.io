<h1> I don't care if people like me - January 3rd, 2025</h1>

<p>
I'm not a pariah. How many Tweets must a man tweet out? Before it'll catch him a baaaaaaaan. I don't care. Perfect is the enemy of good. But good enough is the enemy of humanity. The waste that exists in all our so called "industries". the scams that lurk under every air of legitimacy. The folks we admire for being free. Why? It's like verything about them is something magical. escpecially against the backdrop of crushing conformity mediocrity and heirarchy. When the VCs wanted to say "Good Idea kid, grown ups will take it from here. But not this time! this is OUR time. This time, your gonna hand them a business card that says 'I'm CEO, bitch'. That's what I want for you." Cut out the middleman. If anyone tells you "this is the way its done" they are scamming you. Be who you want to be TODAY. I promise it will open every door you want to enter in the future. To trade our freedom for security, to sacrifice our own values and dreams for an external metric of legitimacy is to kill ourselves and all that is sacred within us. Live in a box, I don't care. But the key is that the world is so large and impossibly vast. There does not exist any circumstance which sets the future in stone. And all triumphs, victorys, status, prosperity are but one side of the coin. When I see someone in unfortunate circumstances, I think "There but for the grace of god, go I." when I see someone in better circumstances, "There because of the grace of god go I." The ultimate mistake is to buy our own bullshit, and say because X Y and Z, I have now reached a new tier of life. Even the president of the united states sometimes must have to stand naked.
