<h1> NeoVim and C Lang on Arch - May 27th, 2025</h1>

<p>
Spent a large chunk of the day getting my neovim config set up to start learning how to code in c. Right now I know just basic control flow and printing and getting input, still memorizing the pointer syntax, but i wanted to be able to see more methods like I have in other IDEs just to be able to browse the capabilities and maybe save time when writing more complex programs. I managed to get my C lsp working perfectly which has been a goal of mine for a while. I went and pulled down my C projects repository from github using the CLI interface and realized I was pretty much ready to go to start coding in my new Arch setup, finally feeling like I can use nvim to browse and strip away all the extra stuff that comes in modern IDEs. I want to focus on the bare minimum, and progress down the stack until i get to the metal. C lang, being able to build whatever like legos, and then I will explore assemply language as well.

So far using this arch linux machine has been absolutely incredible and i feel for the first time I have all the necessary skills to be able to start clawing my way towards any computer project I want. What's even better is I can blog from the glowing command line, making me feel like Zuck at the beginning of that hacker movie.
