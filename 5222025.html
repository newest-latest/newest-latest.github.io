<h1> Arch Linux Macbook Air - May, 22, 2025</h1>

<p>
I just spent the last few days finally installing arch linux on my 2014 Macbook Air. I wasn't using it for anything else and I figured that Arch Linux would be a great way to get cracked on the computer. Boy it has been a fucking headache, many times I've said to myself, "You're nothing but a phony, a fraud. A dumbass who couldn't even shit on the floor. You're such a stupid, stupid idiot, there are 16b year olds who figured this shit out already." And still those moments continue, but at least one of my dreams has been realized: I have successfully installed Arch Linux on a Macbook Air and it is actually useful. It makes me feel like a dope hacker to be typing on this glowing terminal with no GUI just me and the cold, shitty stack traces. Errors upon errors. But this old hunk of metal has a battery life thats about three times what it was before Arch, and I have to say, even though I can't figure out how to open a single image on this machine yet, I've been addicted to it ever since I pulled off the install which was, undoubtedly, a huge moment of triumph for me.

Now I'm using it for another important purpose: To update this blog. I write this blog in raw html in a cold terminal window in the dark... when im high on marijuana. And guess what. It works. I get all my thoughts from here to ther seamlessly. But more importantly, i FEEL like Mark Zuckerberg when I do it. Not the real Zuck, the Jesse Eisenberg COOL zuck. The one talking about breaking out emacs and modifying that perlscript, something that when I saw the movie in 2011 I didn't understand at all, but now are some things I've actually done. I am proud of my achievement and I'm learning a lot every day.

But I won't stop. Until one condition is met.

I will not stop until I am rich, full stop.

Love che
